# DiY-Continuous-Flow-Analyzer-for-Spectrophotometric-
This project presents a low-cost, portable spectrophotometer system designed to allow real-time monitoring of spectrophotometric active chemical compound. The device integrates a 3D-printed microfluidic flow cell, RGB LED light source, AS7341 spectral sensor, peristaltic pump, and solenoid valve, all controlled via Arduino and Python. 

This project is designed to support maker education in chemistry, particularly in undergraduate analytical chemistry. It enables students to build and customize their own spectrophotometer, encouraging hands-on exploration of instrumentation, sensor integration, and data analysis. Through this project, students gain experience with Arduino-based systems, chemical data collection, and 3D-printing techniques, fostering practical skills in data processing and instrumental design. Ideal for project-based learning in chemistry curricula.
