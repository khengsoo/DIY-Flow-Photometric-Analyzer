# DiY-Continuous-Flow-Analyzer-for-Spectrophotometric-
This project presents a low-cost, portable spectrophotometer system designed to allow real-time monitoring of spectrophotometric active chemical compound. The device integrates a 3D-printed microfluidic flow cell, RGB LED light source, AS7341 spectral sensor, peristaltic pump, and solenoid valve, all controlled via Arduino and Python.
