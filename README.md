# DiY-Continuous-Flow-Analyzer-for-Spectrophotometric-
This project presents a low-cost, portable spectrophotometer system designed to allow real-time monitoring of spectrophotometrically active chemical compounds. The device integrates a 3D-printed microfluidic flow cell, RGB LED light source, AS7341 spectral sensor, peristaltic pump, and solenoid valve, all controlled via Arduino and Python. 

It is designed to support maker education in chemistry, particularly in undergraduate analytical chemistry. It enables students to build and customize their own continuous flow analyser-based spectrophotometer, encouraging hands-on exploration of instrumentation, sensor integration, and data analysis. Through this project, students gain experience with Arduino-based systems, chemical data collection, and 3D-printing techniques, fostering practical skills in data processing and instrumental design. Ideal for project-based learning in chemistry curricula.

## Educational Use
This project is ideal for undergraduate analytical chemistry courses with a focus on project-based learning and maker-centered education. Students can:
- Build and customize a functional spectrophotometer
- Understand the technical components of analytical instrumentation
- Collect, process, and analyze spectrophotometric data
- Integrate Arduino programming into chemical analysis workflows
- Use 3D printing to prototype microfluidic or flow-based systems

By engaging in this hands-on project, students develop a deeper understanding of how modern tools—microcontrollers, sensors, and open-source hardware—can be applied to chemical data acquisition and analysis.
