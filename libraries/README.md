# Libraries used
This project uses a combination of Arduino and Python libraries to control hardware, acquire data, and process results.


## Arduino Library 
1. DFRobot_AS7341

Communicates with the AS7341 spectral sensor to read multi-channel absorbance data.

Link to library: [DFRobot_AS7341 Library](https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_AS7341)

For more details, see the [AS7341 datasheet](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2211.html).


## Python Library
1. pandas
2. pyserial
3. matplotlib

To install the required Python libraries, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

`pip install pandas pyserial matplotlib`

If you are using Jupyter Notebook, you can install them directly inside a notebook cell by running:

`!pip install pandas pyserial matplotlib`
